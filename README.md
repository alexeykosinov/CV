## Alexey Kosinov, 29 y.o., Moscow, Russia

Formerly radio engineer, located in Moscow, looking for a interesting job, deeply connected with the embedded development electronic hardware and FPGA. Possesses skills, which required to perform complex tasks in the area of building digital control and acquisition systems for a remote sensing satellites. I have experience to develop firmware for a Xilinx FPGA's and 8- and 16-bit's Atmel microcontrollers.

## Skills

#### Embedded Skills

- lower-speed interfaces such as I2C, SPI, 1-wire, UART - and various modification depends on the task
- high-speed SerDes transceivers: custom development, tunning, debugging
- fiber optics transceivers communication
- connectivity between FPGA and DAC / ADC using LVDS-bus or JESD204 protocol
- using system setting of FPGA to control internal resource susing ICAP (partial reconfiguration, multiboot, single event upset)
- memory implementation such as RAM, ROM, FIFO
- debugging using pattern generators and analysis them on the receive side

#### Hardware Skills
- manual tracing logical blocks on the crystal
- pre-/post-topological analysis, delay analysis
- strong lab skills, including the use of common test and measurement equipment (oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, etc.) to debug complex electronic circuits
- start-to-finish design skills with industry-standard CAD/EDA tools, including schematic entry, PCB layout, component definition, and CAD library management (Mentor Graphics Xpedition, have some experience with Altium Designer and Allegro PCB)
- PCB Analysis and Verification tool: Mentor Graphics HyperLynx and Cedence Sigrity
